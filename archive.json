(Example: NS=Nil UUID, data = 0x44 (\u00abD\u00bb).\r\n\r\nThe RFC should enforce the value of the bit to 0 or 1, or clarify if it should be left untouched depending on the context-dependent data (Clock ID {1,2}, hash output {3,5}, random input {4}). (Which would mean it's then just a libuuid bug to forcibly set Msb2 to 0 when it should be untouched.)\r\n\r\nSee also : https://uuid.pirate-server.com/blog/brother-uuids-or-why-uuids-are-not-unique.html",

So, the most significant bits comes first and they are located in first bytes. So, 0 through 3.\r\n\r\n### VERIFIER NOTES\r\nThis erratum is correct as far as it goes, but, given other text in the RFC, so is erratum 1957. There is a pervasive problem in this RFC with inconsistent and unclear usage of bit numbering, which switches between several conventions. The diagram in Section 4.1.2 uses left-to-right bit numbering (the most significant bit is numbered 0), but much of the text (such as in Section 4.2.2) uses right-to-left bit numbering (the least significant bit is numbered 0). Most of the text uses big-ending byte order (network byte order), but some seems to assume little-ending, probably mistakes that come from the authors' familiarity with that convention.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the text in question, the first sentence of Section 4.1.3, we have the following situation:\r\n\r\n- The original text is correct if we assume right-to-left bit numbering and little-endian byte order.\r\n\r\n- Erratum 1957 is correct if we assume right-to-left bit numbering and big-endian byte order. This change also makes the first sentence of Section 4.1.3 consistent with the sixth bullet in Section 4.2.2.\r\n\r\n- Erratum 3546 is correct if we assume left-to-right bit numbering and big-endian byte order.\r\n\r\nIn the end, the real point is that this document needs a revision that carefully and thoroughly fixes every instance of byte numbering (or removes the byte numbering and refers only to \"most significant\" and \"least significant\"). Such a revision should also double-check the sample code in Appendix A to be sure it works in both big-ending and little-endian machines.\r\n\r\nHappily, it's not likely that misunderstandings here will cause actual interoperability problems: this isn't a situation where things need to be disassembled and reassembled. The algorithm merely turns a UUID into a URN, and the URN is thereafter a \"black box\", an unchanged identifier. The only issue would be whether different interpretations of the document would turn two different UUIDs into the same URN, and, given the number of bits involved, the likelihood of collisions in practice is small.",

Variant 0 uses `AF_UNSPEC` in that case.\r\n\r\nHowever, the range of the Omni-UUID isn't reserved yet. This issue suggests to reserve a variant of the Omni-UUID. I would suggest to only reserve the `0xFF` variant. Why? I will explain.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of UUID, there was no such thing as variants. There was only \"family\". This family field consisted of only one single byte, so it ranged from 0 to 255. In modern days, this is the same byte as where the variant byte is in. With this information, the new variant table will be this:\r\n| Msb0 | Msb1 | Msb2 | As Byte | Values | Description |\r\n| - | - | - | - | - | - |\r\n| 0 | * | * | `0b0*******` | From 0 to 127 | Reserved, NCS backward compatibility. |\r\n| 1 | 0 | * | `0b10******` | From 128 to 191 | The variant specified in this document. |\r\n| 1 | 1 | 0 | `0b110*****` | From 192 to 223 | Reserved, Microsoft Corporation backward compatibility |\r\n| 1 | 1 | 1 | `0b111*****`<br>---<br>`0b11111111` | From 224 to 254<br>---<br>Only 255 | Reserved for future definition.<br>---<br>Omni-UUID variant |\r\n\r\nHandling the variant/family like this, it has at least 2 advantages:\r\n - It reserves a variant for the Omni-UUID, so that there will be no conflicts when a new variant will be specificed.\r\n - You clearly see that there are 31 variant slots open for definition (32 including Omni-UUID variant).\r\n\r\nThis doesn't mean that Variant 255 always should have all bits set to 1. It only reserves the range the Omni-UUID is in. I also think it is important to add this variant in this specification, because this specification defines the Omni-UUID itself.",

Forget about how the table is in RFC 4122. In the good old Apollo Computer days, there was a `family` field that was exactly 8 bits. Because only 13 families where used back then, the makers of RFC 4122 decided when starting with a 0-bit, it was variant 0 and defined families, and when starting with a 1-bit, it was another variant.\r\n\r\nMaking the variant field variable length, doesn't make any sense. It was defined on the same location as the family field on purpose. I would almost rather say: the variant field IS the family field.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWhat I think should be done? Well, I would recommend to redefine all variants to their 8-bit format, where `x` is a \"don't care\", so variant `0` becomes `0xxxxxxx`, variant `10` becomes `10xxxxxx` and variant `110` becomes `110xxxxx`. Why is this useful? Because you can assign ranges to it (see column 'Values' in my table). Instead of checking seperate bits, you just read the `family` byte, check the ranges, and you know the variant. Using 8-bit notation is also easier to understand and better to use in some IANA registry.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n> do we need to limit the variant field to one byte rather than the remaining 64 bits?\r\n\r\nLook at what happened to `10xxxxxx`. This variant supports multiple versions. If you are afraid of running out of variants in the future, just reserve one variant now using the 8-bit notation and write an RFC that defines how your subversioning works, just like variant 1 in RFC 4122.

Versions are specific to the `0b10` variant and have nothing to do with the future variants. If the future `0b111` authors believe they need sub-variants, they will allocate another version bits somewhere in the 128-bit space. If not, the version field will simply go away and the four bits will be utilized differently. We should let them decide, as we can't foresee the future.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if the future authors are considerate enough of the future of UUID spec, they will likely take the `0b1110` variant so the next future authors can take `0b1111`, just as https://github.com/uuid6/uuid6-ietf-draft/issues/26 tried to. E variant is out of scope, but the discussion clearly demonstrates how the `var` field can be utilized in the future. Similarly, `0b1111` takers are likely to reserve `0b1111_1`, `0b1111_1` takers to reserve `0b1111_11`, and so on. In this way, the `var` field can be variable-length, which might grows over many decades. I don't mean we should reserve 64 variants right now.\r\n\r\nI now think it's a good idea to add one paragraph below Table 1 stating the above intention to guide future authors like:\r\n\r\n> Future RFC authors who consume the reserved \"111\" variant are encouraged to (or, simply, SHOULD) define the \"1110\" variant and reserve the \"1111\" variant so that the next future authors can extend the UUID specification using the \"1111\" variant as well as the new variant does not conflict with the Max UUID.\r\n\r\nWe can only encourage (but not enforce) this rule because, as long as `var` starts with `0b111`, the future authors can do whatever they want without conflicting with the old standards. We cannot enforce the \"one byte `var`\" rule either for the same reason.\r\n",

Which does it mean:\r\n\r\n1. the node SHOULD be reset to a pseudo-random number every time a new UUIDv6 is generated; or,\r\n2. the node SHOULD be initialized at a pseudo-random number only once at the system boot?\r\n\r\nThe old RFC 4122 doesn't seem clear enough, or it is rather so permissive as to accept many kinds of spatially unique identifiers. It's okay for v1 to be ambiguous; we must anyway keep it as ambiguous as it has been. Since v6 should be compatible with v1, everything should also be permitted under v6, but questions arise on which method v6 should recommend as default. We don't need to be ambiguous here.\r\n\r\nIf the first option is the way to go, the following text in Section 5.6:\r\n\r\n> The clock sequence bits remain unchanged from their usage and position in Section 5.1.\r\n>\r\n> The 48 bit node SHOULD be set to a pseudo-random value however implementations MAY choose to retain the old MAC address behavior from Section 5.1 and Section 6.9. For more information on MAC address usage within UUIDs see the Section 9\r\n\r\ncan be reworded in a much simpler way as:\r\n\r\n> The clock sequence and node bits SHOULD be reset to a pseudo-random value for each new UUIDv6 generated; however, implementations MAY choose to retain the UUIDv1 behavior from Section 5.1.\r\n\r\nbecause the clock sequence bits are reset to a random number when the node ID changes. Refreshing `node` to a random number every time is equivalent to resetting both `clock_seq` and `node` to random numbers every time. This point seems clear from Section 4.2.1 and Appendix A of the old RFC 4122.\r\n\r\nIf the latter option is recommended, the RFC should state that explicitly.",
